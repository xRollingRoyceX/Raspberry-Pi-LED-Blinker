#Raspberry Pi LED Morse Code Blinker

#written for people who like C++, and for those, like me, learning to Code.

Change the LED pins your using, make sure you are using root, make sure you convert the pins
correctly - and please be safe :)
noticed their was no C++ code for this, it was mostly in Python and Java - 
I thought them both to look a bit sloppy and hard to follow 
(KISS, because just because you can make something complex does not mean you should)
I also tried to keep the the spirit of C++11 as much as possible. 
and... ive come quite a way in coding :)
to make running this code easier - use this as a batch file below:

#/bin/bash

#written july 26t.

cd /home/pi/C++/Rbp_Morse_Code_Blinker/

sudo test


rewrite this above, fit it with your needs - after save and in the directory that contains the batch file,
use the terminal and use command chmod +x <filename>
press ls and it will turn green.
filename references the name of the batch file, not the C++ files
run this with sudo


#if i can help let me know, simple :)
